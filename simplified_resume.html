                    <p>I am a mobile developer with over 4 years of experience in both cross-platform and native app development. My technical expertise includes building applications using cross-platform framework like <b>Uno Platform</b>, <b>Xamarin</b>, <b>.NET MAUI</b>, <b>React Native</b>, as well as native development with <b>Java</b>, <b>Kotlin</b>, <b>Objective-C</b> and <b>Swift</b>. I managed a lot of <b>CI/CD</b> pipelines using <b>YAML</b> and <b>Fastlane</b> to automate the process. I have played a key role in the end-to-end development lifecycle—leading the design, implementation, testing, deployment, and publishing of multiple successful mobile applications. I have also offered my help on a couple of <b>web development</b> projects, including one using <b>Elixir</b>, <b>React</b>, and <b>PostgreSQL</b>.</p>
